We're going to be writing an industry RSA algorithm

Protocol:
	1. Block size is 600 digits
	2. Plaintext uses padded ascii
		t = 116
		A = 65
		make them all the same length by adding 100
		A = 165
		t = 216
	3. Pick 2 random primes of approx 1024 bits each such that:
		a. The product is exactly 600 digits in length
		b. The product n > 355355...355 
		Then you have found a good modulus. It will be part of your public key.
